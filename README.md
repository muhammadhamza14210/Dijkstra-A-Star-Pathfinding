Dijkstra-A-star-Pathfinding

Overview

n this assignment you will implement Dijkstra’s algorithm and A* for solving pathfinding problems on video game maps. We will consider a grid environment where each action in the four cardinal directions (north, south, east, and west) has the cost of 1.0 and each action in one of the four diagonal directions has the cost of 1.5. Each search problem is defined by a video game map, a start location, and a goal location. The assignment package available on eClass includes a large number of maps from movingai.com, but you will use a single map in our experiments; feel free to explore other maps if you like.

Most of the code you need is already implemented in the assignment package. In the next section, we detail some of the key functions you will use from the starter code. You can reimplement all these functions if you prefer, their use isn’t mandatory. The assignment must be implemented in Python, however.
